# Driving_Cycle

Driving_Cycle is a data-driven framework for generating and analyzing realistic driving cycles. This repository provides the necessary code and resources to implement the framework and utilize its features.

➡️ **Please note that the proposed method of code provided in this repository is currently under review for publication.**

## Features

-   Generation of realistic driving cycles using advanced techniques.
-   Incorporation of Markov chain modeling, Monte Carlo simulations, and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW).
-   Accurate representation of the complexity and stochastic nature of real-world driving behavior.

## Dataset
The dataset provided in this repository consists of 19 driving cycles collected from the city of [Igdir, Turkey](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/39.9216343,44.0418135/39.9200546,44.0435517/39.9225889,44.0442167/39.9337557,44.0489844/39.9375393,44.079913/39.9372601,44.0802923/39.9043953,44.0609652/39.9193395,44.0416492/@39.9206967,44.0585684,14z/data=!4m2!4m1!3e0?entry=ttu). The driving cycles were recorded using an [On-Board Diagnostic II (OBD-II)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-board_diagnostics) device installed in a 5-door vehicle. The data was acquired onboard using an Android device.
 
The driving cycles cover a route of approximately 11,150 meters, including two main arteries (D080 and E99 international trade routes) connecting Turkey to Asian countries. The dataset includes driving cycles during both peak and off-peak hours, as well as on weekdays and weekends, to reflect a variety of driving situations under diverse traffic congestion scenarios.

## Accessing the Data
To access the data, simply download the txt files available in the "[Data](https://github.com/for-reviewing/Driving_Cycle/tree/main/Data)" folder of this repository. The txt files contain time-speed profiles for each driving cycle, providing detailed temporal information about velocities, vehicle acceleration/deceleration parameters.
